##About our data portal

The Montana Local Government Center has created this web site for citizens and government officials to access and visualize information about Montana city and county governments. We welcome your suggestions as we develop and expand the data and visualization tools available here. 

The main web site for the Local Government Center is <a href="http://www.msulocalgov.org">msulocalgov.org</a>. Data presented here is also available there in the form of composite wallcharts (pdf format).

##About the Local Government Center

Our mission is to strengthen the capacities of local governmental units and provide training, technical assistance, and research services to elected, appointed, and administrative officials. We work to support Montanaâ€™s cities, towns, and counties by partnering with local government practitioners and their professional associations.
