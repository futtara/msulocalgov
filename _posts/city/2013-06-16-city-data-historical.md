##City Historical Charts

On this page you can chart numerical data for the years available in the Local Government Center database (from 1991 for some data to present). Choose which type of data to display using the drop-down menu.

You can display data for a single selected city or up to 5 cities in the same chart. Hovering or clicking on a data point will show the data value for that point.

*Note: some data is currently missing or unverified.*
