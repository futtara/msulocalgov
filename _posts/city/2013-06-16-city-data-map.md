##City Data Maps

A geographical display of information makes it easy to compare across cities within the state. It can also lead to insights into characteristics related to geography.

Choose the type of information to display using the drop-down menu. You may also select the year for which the data is taken.

Hovering or clicking on a city will display details for that city.

*Note: some data is currently missing or unverified.*
