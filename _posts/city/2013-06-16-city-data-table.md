##City Data Tables

Data on Montana cities can be viewed in three different ways: for a selected year, for a selected city, or for a selected data type (scroll vertically and horizontally to view all data).

Terms are defined in the glossary, which you can view by clicking the button in the upper right corner on any chart page. Individual definitions may also be provided by hovering over a column label with your mouse.
