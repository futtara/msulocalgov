##County Comparison Charts

This interactive chart allows you to compare counties according to 1, 2, or 3 kinds of data. This allows you to see relationships that might exist, for example between funding levels and population. Deviations from those relationships are also noticeable.

*Note: some data is currently missing or unverified.*
