##County Comparison Charts

This interactive chart allows you to compare counties according to 1, 2, or 3 kinds of data. Select which data to display using the drop-down menus. Also select the desired year. 

You may order the data in descending order by any data type by clicking on the corresponding label (e.g. "Population").

Hovering or clicking on any bar will display the data value for that bar.

*Note: some data is currently missing or unverified.*
