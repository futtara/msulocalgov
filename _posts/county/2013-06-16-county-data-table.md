##County Data Tables

Data on Montana counties can be viewed in three different ways. Use one of the menus below to display all data for a selected year, for a selected county, or for a selected data type. Because there is a large amount of data, you may have to scroll vertically and horizontally.

Within a view, you can re-order the rows according to the values in a column by clicking on the column label. You can also hide unwanted columns to simplify the table.

*Note: some data is currently missing or unverified.*
