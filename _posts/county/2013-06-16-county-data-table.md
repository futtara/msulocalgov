##County Data Tables

Data on Montana counties can be viewed in three different ways. You may display all data for a selected year, for a selected county, or for a selected data type. Because there is a large amount of data, you may have to scroll vertically and horizontally.

Some data types are defined in the glossary, which you can view by clicking the button in the upper right corner on any chart page. Individual definitions may also be provided by hovering over a column label with your mouse.

*Note: some data is currently missing or unverified.*
