##County Government Review

This chart summarizes the history of Montana's local government review process at the county level. Every 10 years, beginning in 1974, there is an opportunity for a citizen review that lasts 2 years. If a proposal for change is made, the voters decide whether or not to accept the proposal.

If you hover or click on a segment of the chart, it will display the form of government at that time, or proposed in the case of a short '04 - '06 segment. The rows can be ordered either alphabetically or according to the current form of government.
