Taxable Valuation (Mill Value),"<p>The taxable valuation is the portion (percentage) of the appraised value of any property that is subject to a property tax mill levy. Both the appraised value and the resulting taxable value are determined by periodic, appraisals conducted by the Montana Department of Revenue applying a tax rate enacted by the legislature and furnished to all units of local government as annual, certified taxable values lying within the local government&#8217;s jurisdiction. The taxable value is the basis for the local government&#8217;s mill value, which is the taxable value of the jurisdiction divided by 1,000.</p><p>The property tax burden to support municipal government spending varies widely and primarily as a function of the extent to which the property tax base includes significant commercial or industrial assets. Hence, the property tax mill levy in a rural Montana town is likely to be disproportionately higher than one might encounter in any of Montana&#8217;s large, metropolitan communities precisely because the larger communities include a substantial commercial and industrial component in their taxable valuation. In many of Montana&#8217;s smaller, rural communities the greatest share of the property tax burden is carried by single-family, residential property.
